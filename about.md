## What's ADDRESS?


The United States has long suffered from digital inequality that stretches in multiple dimensions. For instance, rural and tribal regions are far less likely than urban cities to have high quality, high-speed Internet access. Several demographic and socioeconomic factors, such as race, ethnicity, income, etc., are often indicators of Internet availability and quality. To fully bridge the Internet access divide and best allocate available funding, policymakers need to understand the state of Internet accessibility and quality. Further, they not only require accurate information on distributions of Internet quality in a geographical region, but also the contributors to the distributionâ€™s tail (regions of poor quality). In essence, policymakers need data that enables a complete characterization of Internet access quality at the most refined geographical granularity (i.e., street address level). The data should provide the following information: (1) where precisely the access does (not) exist, (2) what broadband plans are available in a region, and (3) where precisely the networks do (not) meet the service goals. To help provide this information, crowdsourced Internet mea surement datasets, such as those collected by Measurement Lab, Ookla, and Measuring Broadband Amer ica (MBA), report actual Internet performance at the test locations. However, these datasets have a variety of limitations. They are temporally and spatially sparse and unevenly distributed; they are noisy with respect to accurate identification of the actual path bottleneck; and they have biases along multiple dimen sions, including across demographic and socioeconomic variables. Our work will address these deficiencies through novel statistical techniques to augment, denoise, and debias crowdsourced Internet measurement datasets to provide the critical policy data discussed above.
