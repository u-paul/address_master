The ADDRESS project aims to `Augment`, `Denoise` and `Debias` crowdsourced measurements for statistical synthesis of Internet access characterization.

## Project Overview
### Internet Inequity in the US
The United States has long suffered from digital inequality that stretches in multiple dimensions. For instance, rural and tribal regions are far less likely than urban cities to have high quality, high-speed Internet access.
Several demographic and socioeconomic factors, such as race, ethnicity, income, etc., are often indicators of Internet availability and quality.

### Countering Internet Inequity
To fully bridge the Internet access divide and best allocate available funding, policymakers need to understand the state of Internet accessibility and quality.
Further, they not only require accurate information on distributions of Internet quality in a geographical region, but also the contributors to the
distributionâ€™s tail (regions of poor quality).

In essence, policymakers need data that enables a complete characterization of Internet access quality at the most refined geographical granularity (i.e., street address level). The data should provide the following information:
1. Where precisely the access does (not) exist,
2. What broadband plans are available in a region, and
3. Where precisely the networks do (not) meet the service goals.

### Using Crowdsourced Speed Test Data to Aid Policy Decisions
To help provide this information, crowdsourced Internet measurement datasets, such as those collected by `Measurement Lab (MLab)`, `Ookla`,and `Measuring Broadband America (MBA)`, report actual Internet performance at the test locations.

However, these datasets have a variety of limitations. They are temporally and spatially sparse and unevenly distributed; they are noisy with respect to accurate identification of the actual path bottleneck; and they have biases along multiple dimensions, including across demographic and socioeconomic variables. This project aims to **address** these deficiencies through novel statistical techniques to `augment`, `denoise`, and `debias` crowdsourced Internet measurement datasets to provide the critical policy data discussed above.
